##I. File list

	1. \plant
		We use MRAA to convert C / C ++ functions into JavaScript.
		So we build a webside on 86duino, you can see all values (humidity, water quantity, temperature...etc.)
		and live camera to take care your plant on this webside.
		
	2. \UI_display
		The UI used SDL to draw graphical interface, then usb display will show all values.
